"""
Cost assumptions and decision maths, shared by train.py and app.py.

The numbers below are YOUR business assumptions. Fill them in and justify
each one in REPORT.md ("Cost matrix and operating point").

Decision unit: one image = one fruit case on the sorting line.
Three outcomes per case, based on the model's highest "rotten" confidence:
    score >= t_high          -> FAIL   (fruit is discarded)
    t_low <= score < t_high  -> REVIEW (a person checks it)
    score <  t_low           -> PASS   (fruit is shipped)
With t_low == t_high there is no review: the model decides alone.
Assumption: the human reviewer is always right.
